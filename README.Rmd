This repository presents an overview of the different datasets that could be used for the SATURN project.

The dependent variable for the SATURN project is cycling levels. The main independent variable is lighting (road or ambient lighting). Other relevant independent variables are road safety (road traffic casualties or near misses), crime or offences, cycling infrastructure, and deprivation.
